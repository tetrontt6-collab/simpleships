First of all, thank you for offering free plugin development to help people. I genuinely appreciate it, and I think it's really cool that you're willing to spend your time helping server owners and developers with their projects.

I have a project that I think is relatively simple compared to building an entire plugin from scratch, because most of the source code already exists and I've already made some modifications myself (with a lot of AI assistance, since I'm not very experienced with Java plugin development).

The project is based on this plugin:

"https://share.google/t0liAznSS9dJfidvK" 

It's an open-source plugin from Modrinth called SimpleShips. It allows players to build ships and then move them around as entities.

My goal is to turn it into a naval warfare system with cannons, ship HP, sinking mechanics, and ship storage.

With AI assistance I've already managed to implement or partially implement several features:

- Captain recognition (only the player who placed the helm can pilot the ship).
- Permission-based ship size limits.
- Some work toward ship HP and damage systems.
- Some work toward ship sinking and ship storage.

For the sinking system, my idea is that when a ship reaches 0 HP, it gets removed and saved. The owner can later recover it or permanently delete it.

I also added a custom command hook that executes:

Ir0Qv4nt540f383

when a ship sinks.

This isn't meant to be a real command players use. It's simply a coded event hook that I can later integrate with other systems. For example:

- Counting how many times a player has been sunk.
- Statistics.
- Quests.
- Achievements.
- Economy rewards.
- Anything else I might want to connect later.

One important detail: this command should be executed by the captain/player who owned the ship, not by the console.

One major issue with ships turning into entities while moving is that players tend to slip off or fall right through them.

​- Relative Ship Movement: I need a system ensuring that if a player is standing on a ship while it is in motion, they move along with it automatically.

​- Freedom of Movement: Even if they are just standing up normally (not explicitly riding or sitting on an entity), the ship should carry them with it. From the player's perspective, they should be able to freely walk around the deck while the ship is actively moving across the water without falling off.

(possibly, make this option disableable via config)

There are also planned effects after sinking (blindness and similar things), but I haven't been able to properly test any of that because the actual ship damage system never worked correctly.

Because of that, everything that is supposed to happen after a ship reaches 0 HP may need to be reviewed. I simply never managed to get a ship to actually sink through combat, so I couldn't fully test the entire flow.

The main thing I need help with is the cannon and damage system.

My idea is:

Every dispenser placed on a ship should be treated as a cannon.

When the captain is sitting at the helm and left-clicks, every loaded dispenser on the ship fires simultaneously.

Each shot should consume 1 Fire Charge from the dispenser.

After firing, all ship cannons should enter a cooldown of 20 seconds.

If possible, I'd love this cooldown to be permission-based, similar to how the ship size permissions work. Something like:

cannon.cooldown.X

where X is the cooldown value.

This part is optional if it would make things significantly more complicated.

I would also like players to be able to manually fire individual cannons using a button attached directly to the dispenser.

In that case the cooldown would always be 5 seconds and wouldn't need permissions.

For damage:

When a cannonball hits a ship:

- TNT explosion particles should appear.
- TNT explosion sounds should play.
- No blocks should actually be destroyed.
- No players or mobs should take damage.
- Only ships should receive damage.

When a ship gets hit, everyone onboard that ship should see a boss bar displaying the ship's HP.

The boss bar should disappear if there has been no combat activity for 7 seconds.

The sinking system described above would then take over when HP reaches zero.

One thing I'm unsure about is how damage should be handled when a ship is not moving.

When the captain stops piloting, SimpleShips reconstructs the ship back into normal blocks. While moving, the ship is essentially an entity structure, but when stationary it becomes a normal block structure again.

I'm not sure what the best approach would be for detecting and applying damage in that situation, so if you have a cleaner idea I'd be happy to hear it.

I would also love a command similar to:

/shipbottle

If the player is the captain of a ship:

- The ship structure gets saved.
- The ship is removed from the world.
- The player receives a normal vanilla water bottle with a custom name/lore (something like "Ship in a Bottle").

When the bottle is used in water with enough available space:

- The saved ship is recreated.
- Entities are NOT restored.

So things like:

- Helms
- Armor Stand decorations
- Custom parrots
- Mobs
- Other entities

would simply not be included in the saved data.

The bottle itself becomes the ownership record.

If the player loses the bottle, the ship is effectively lost.

If another player obtains the bottle and uses it, that player can spawn the ship.
ㅤ
For HP balancing, my idea is that ship HP should scale based on the amount of blocks used to build the ship.

Large ships would naturally have more HP.

Small ships would have less HP.

Since SimpleShips already makes larger ships slower and smaller ships faster, I think this creates a nice balance where larger ships gain survivability instead of only looking better.

The plugin already has systems that count ship blocks, so hopefully that information can be reused.

For permissions, I'd also like something similar to:

ship.damage.X

to control damage values.

And:

ship.cannons.X

to control the maximum number of dispensers/cannons allowed on a ship.

I'm mainly interested in knowing:

- Do you think this is feasible?
- How difficult would you consider it?
- Which parts are easy and which parts are difficult?
- Roughly how long do you think it would take?

Most importantly, a large portion of the groundwork is already done, so you wouldn't be starting from scratch.

If you're interested, I can send the full source code along with all the modifications I've already made.

Thank you again for offering your time and helping the community!
